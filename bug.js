This bug occurs when using the Expo DocumentPicker API on Android.  The picker opens, but after selecting a file, the promise returned by DocumentPicker.getDocumentAsync() never resolves.  The app appears to hang indefinitely. This issue is intermittent and doesn't occur every time the picker is used.  No error messages are logged to the console.  The behavior is consistent across different Android versions and devices.  Other Expo APIs, such as ImagePicker, function correctly.
